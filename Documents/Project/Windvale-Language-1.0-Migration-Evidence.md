# Windvale Language 1.0 migration evidence

## Status

Decision 0767 freezes the source design. This page records implementation and
measurement evidence outside that immutable identity. It must not be read as a
claim that the complete Language 1.0 compiler, Foundation, runtime, editor, or
any natural-language pack is implemented.

The current checkpoint establishes the Slice 0 identity/inventory baseline and
the first bounded Slice 1 component: an edition-1 source-descriptor reader. Seed
remains the implemented compiler language. Exact profile resolution, lexicon and
catalog loading, Unicode identifier admission, standalone metadata, parsing,
typing, lowering, and cross-host Language 1.0 qualification remain pending.

## Frozen source identity

The verifier binds the exact replacement source frozen by
[Decision 0767](../Decisions/0767-Freeze-Windvale-Language-1.0-Source.md):

| Evidence | Exact value |
| --- | ---: |
| Freeze manifest bytes | 3,702 |
| Freeze manifest SHA-256 | `c9517841eae6b6e86778cb1dd88711feb38929dec8fe79e084eec44fa22c512a` |
| Frozen inputs | 250 |
| Frozen input bytes | 1,724,854 |
| Frozen aggregate SHA-256 | `fb918a763ae7c8c85dd1a2ffecee6587ab93bbf846ae31ae19b53509aed36a0a` |

`Tests/Native/Language-1.0-Fixture-Inventory.txt` further fixes 16 workload
bundles containing 72 `.wv` source fixtures and 482,325 source bytes. The
inventory records the exact source count, byte count, aggregate identity,
planned migration slices, and current standing of every bundle. The verifier
recomputes every identity and validates every fixture's UTF-8 encoding and
bounded ASCII descriptor.

These are executable identity and descriptor checks, not yet executable claims
for the fixtures' remaining Language 1.0 syntax or semantics. Their inventory
standing therefore remains explicitly `identity-only`.

## First descriptor component

`Compiler/Windvale/Source-Descriptor-Core.wv` reads only the first physical
line and implements the frozen universal descriptor boundary:

- exact byte-zero `#!wv/1 ` admission;
- a 2-through-96-byte ASCII profile identity with the frozen component/atom
  grammar;
- a positive decimal `u32` profile version without a sign, suffix, separator,
  leading zero, or overflow;
- LF and CRLF support with no BOM or preceding bytes;
- a 128-byte maximum excluding the line ending; and
- structured status and byte offsets without allocation or an unbounded scan.

The 34-case self-test covers accepted English and Simplified-Chinese descriptor
shapes, the maximum profile version, missing/unsupported editions, malformed
profiles and versions, BOM/non-ASCII input, line-ending failures, and length
bounds. It returns `42`. Two builds compare byte-identically before execution.
The current deterministic test WVB is 12,589 bytes with SHA-256
`2ac0f81f4d3dbbb342f1f557d263883abb6f4dbe4f3eda2ef31e97109ddc8684`.

This module is part of the existing compiler source area; it is not a second
compiler. It does not yet resolve `en@1` or `zh-Hans@1`, remove the descriptor,
or pass the remaining source to the Language 1.0 lexer. No edition-1 source is
therefore claimed compilable at this checkpoint.

## Focused verification owner

The cross-host `language-1-front-door` owner has three declared cases:

1. recompute the complete frozen identity and fixture inventory;
2. build the descriptor self-test twice and compare exact WVB bytes; and
3. execute the self-test and require the sole output `Result: 42`.

Frozen design inputs and the new descriptor files map to this owner instead of
an unfiltered compiler gate. On the Windows reference host the direct owner took
1.746 seconds. The existing focused `seed` owner separately passed 26 cases in
7.140 seconds, including 6.720 seconds in its owned command. These owner timings
are development feedback measurements, not cold qualification ceilings.

## Pre-slice compiler baseline

The reference source state is commit
`44f677d6853ffd2abebd3533cabe8e91b8a6fc28`, immediately after the source
freeze and before the descriptor component. Measurements ran on Windows NT
10.0.26200.0 x64 with an AMD64 Family 23 Model 113 processor. The compiler
application was the 27,467,776-byte
`Artifacts/Native-Compiler-Seed/windows-x64/wvcompiler.exe`, SHA-256
`344940f66b26b516b8b4e10a712a6b2c01cbff95aa7ff18aac0789ba9197f970`.

The exact `Projects/Examples/Windvale-Compiler.wvproj` order contains 13 modules
and 1,161,243 input bytes. Three optimized direct invocations, without
`--complete`, produced:

| Sample | Elapsed milliseconds | WVB bytes | WVB SHA-256 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 46,143.804 | 959,320 | `e177e418bfd8fdcbe40cfac513ce40e58b95ba5b88a8a1d1db9fe280ae81dbfb` |
| 2 | 46,187.198 | 959,320 | `e177e418bfd8fdcbe40cfac513ce40e58b95ba5b88a8a1d1db9fe280ae81dbfb` |
| 3 | 47,100.433 | 959,320 | `e177e418bfd8fdcbe40cfac513ce40e58b95ba5b88a8a1d1db9fe280ae81dbfb` |

The mean is 46,477.145 milliseconds. A fourth identical invocation took
46,183.648 milliseconds while 50-millisecond process sampling observed a peak
working set of 141,778,944 bytes. Every output reported 445 functions, 790,934
code bytes, and 959,320 module bytes.

The matching source-WIR inspection reports:

```text
source wir status=Valid modules=13 functions=533 blocks=11356 operations=52969 temporaries=48243 operands=42028 directory-bytes=2823444
```

The representative Echo package remains the independently pinned 927-byte WVB,
SHA-256
`b83890661281e79b17d14c49e7b971e37701c8112310b7b5f1f3f05e035dc713`.
It is recorded here from its existing exact application owner; the expensive
cross-target package/execution owner was not rerun merely to restate that
unchanged identity.

## Measurement limitation and next checkpoint

`Tools/Native/Measure-Source-Wvb-Compilation.ps1` currently forces paired
optimized and `--complete` runs. The current native compiler completed the
optimized sample, but its complete mode exited 1 without a diagnostic, so that
driver could not retain this baseline. The direct optimized measurements above
kept exact input order, artifact identity, and temporary cleanup, but peak
working set is a sampled observation rather than an allocation proof.

Before performance comparisons are promoted, the measurement driver needs an
explicit mode selection, retained host metadata, and bounded live memory
sampling. Linux needs the same exact baseline before paired-host performance or
Language 1.0 conformance is claimed.

The next semantic checkpoint is still Slice 1: connect this reader to one
edition-dispatch front door, admit only explicitly locked `en@1` profile data,
strip the descriptor through an offset view rather than a source copy, and fail
honestly on every Language 1.0 construct not yet implemented. Seed stays on the
same compiler architecture until the named removal checkpoint.
