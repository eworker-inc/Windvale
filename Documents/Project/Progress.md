# Windvale progress

> Status snapshot: 2 August 2026

<a href="Images/Windvale-Roadmap-August-2026.svg"><img src="Images/Windvale-Roadmap-August-2026.svg" alt="Windvale roadmap phase map showing qualified, ongoing, current, in-progress, and planned phases" width="100%"></a>

This is an editorial snapshot of the implemented and qualified project state, not a generated completion meter. Windvale phases overlap: later experiments can produce evidence while an earlier, deliberately open-ended foundation phase continues. The [development roadmap](Roadmap.md), accepted decisions, and [qualification evidence](Seed-Verification-Evidence.md) remain authoritative.

## Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
| :---: | --- |
| ✅ Qualified | The phase's defined gate has reproducible evidence. |
| 🔵 Ongoing | Useful qualified slices exist, and the phase continues as real tool pressure demands more. |
| 🎯 Current transfer | The immediate measured ownership boundary being moved into Windvale. |
| 🚧 In progress | Concrete implementation evidence exists, but the phase gate remains open. |
| ○ Planned | The phase has an accepted direction but not yet its completion evidence. |

These indicators describe evidence, not effort. Windvale does not publish percentage-complete estimates because the remaining work changes as compiler, runtime, native, and operating-system experiments reveal better boundaries.

## Roadmap gates

| Phase | Status | Evidence today | Next gate |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| 0–6. Seed through assembler and linker | ✅ Qualified | The Stage 0 foundation, byte primitives, hosted resource boundary, `wvdump`, object model, assembler, and linker have Windows and Debian evidence. | Preserve these contracts as later native and OS work consumes them. |
| 7. Foundation modules | 🔵 Ongoing | Machine contracts, byte ordering, decimal parsing, and byte construction are shared by real Windvale tools. | Add facilities only when measured compiler, runtime, or tool pressure requires them. |
| 8. Self-hosted compiler | ✅ Qualified | The committed 12-module inventory produces byte-identical 599,868-byte Stage 1 and Stage 2 compilers on Windows and Debian; its exact native form compiles a real fixture to byte-identical WVB on both hosts. | Require native Stage 1/Stage 2 equality over the complete compiler inventory. |
| 9. Shared native backend | 🎯 Current transfer | Qualified Decisions 0117–0118 bound record storage at a 1,489-cell worst exact-compiler frame, publish deterministic local/result offsets, and independently prove every live range. | Consume the offsets in selection, independently decode the first frame-owned record ABI, then prove native Stage 1/Stage 2 equality. |
| 10. Native host tools and .NET retirement | 🚧 In progress | Windvale constructs live service leaves and owns image layout/lifecycle; the exact compiler produces the exact 815-byte Stage 0 WVB through Windows and Linux native W^X paths. Paired `windows-x64-console-v1` and `linux-x64-console-v1` slices package the same capability-free scalar fragment as deterministic import-free PE32+ and static-PIE ELF containers, share portable `0…255` process-result semantics, publish executable files atomically, and now have WVA-authored startup candidates with typed-relocation, byte-for-byte C# oracle agreement; Windows direct execution passes while fresh Linux evidence is pending. | Qualify both narrow containers cross-host, then transfer their pure bounded constructors and untrusted-input verifiers into Windvale before adding measured hosted/runtime ownership and satisfying the larger .NET-retirement gate. |
| 11. Boot path and kernel | 🚧 In progress | Probe 32 through ABI 20 / `WVKMEM10` is cross-host qualified with the same `WVPROC11` behavior, a 134-page arena, and a 113-page client root; all four local pinned-QEMU scenarios pass. | Let non-tail lifetime pressure, broader traps, Hyper-V, or a third runnable choose the next kernel slice. |
| 12. Runtime on Windvale OS | ✅ Qualified | Exact `Sum-Data.wv` and `Function-Only.wv` compiler outputs run across both hosts and Windvale OS; the second covers four functions and four scalar families. | Use a third real program or measured native-size pressure to choose further generalization. |
| 13. Public foundation | 🚧 In progress | The public GitHub repository and its licensing, contribution, security, governance, support, and authorship policies are live. | Record the initial publication baseline and establish ongoing public project operations. |
| WebAssembly interoperability | 🚧 In progress | The portable `.wv` selector now adds execution ABI 3 and exact profile-8 `bytes -> bytes` / `text -> text` transport over fixed disjoint 4 MiB linear-memory regions. The shared worker checks memory ownership and strict UTF-8; the static .NET-free route accepts editable text and executes the pinned 791-byte artifact. Profile 5 remains the latest cross-host-qualified boundary. | Implement compiler-required scalar/text/bytes/record/enum and bounded-allocation runtime operations, then a Windvale-native WVB verifier and interpreter/compiler path; obtain cross-host profile-6/7/8 and cross-browser evidence. |

The SVG is a dated visual aid. It should be refreshed only when the phase picture becomes materially misleading; ordinary wording or milestone changes belong in the Markdown sources first.
